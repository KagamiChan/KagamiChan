Hi, I’m かがみ, a web front-end developer. I have been writing JavaScript/TypeScript code for recent years, and sometimes practising C# as well.

I enjoy indoor activities such as watching anime and reading novels. I also spend some time on the development of (poi)[https://github.com/poooi/poi], a browser for Web game Kancolle.

I can speak Chinese, English and French, and I have a basic knowledge of Japanese.
