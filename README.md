Hello! My name is かがみ, and I specialize in front-end web development. Over the past few years, my main focus has been on crafting code in JavaScript/TypeScript, with occasional ventures into C#.

My personal interests lean towards indoor hobbies, including anime, video gaming, and novel reading. Additionally, I contribute to the development of [poi](https://github.com/poooi/poi), which is a web game browser designed for _Kantai Collection_.

I am fluent in Chinese and English, have proficiency in French, and possess a foundational understanding of Japanese.
